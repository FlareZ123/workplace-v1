# [censored] Energy Group — H-17 archive recovery

Records preservation reference: IR-261003-H17 / export 06
Prepared: 4 October 2026, 11:40 UTC

The incident archive appliance is unavailable following the instrument-store
fire on 3 October. Its removable recovery card was in the same cabinet. The
eight-component recovery envelope was designed to draw on records kept in
separate operational streams. This folder contains the material recovered by
the records team, plus offline acceptance commitments taken from the archive
inventory. Recovery unlocks a historical records export, not a control system.

Read `evidence/records-custodian.txt`, `evidence/recovery-routing.json`, and the
email index before reducing machine records. Several files contain old jobs,
revisions, retries, or unrelated plant readings. The preservation set is trimmed;
the original mailboxes and devices are unavailable in this local export.

Last names, mailbox suffixes, domains, company identifiers, personal contact
details, and some unrelated personnel information have been redacted. Names
that remain are first names only. Redaction markers are not recovery material.
Machine identifiers and hexadecimal recovery fields were retained as supplied.

Preserve evidence files. Put your scripts and work log in `work/`, and put your submission in `candidate.json`.

## Offline checks

Python 3, standard library only:

    python verify.py --candidate candidate.json
    python verify.py --candidate candidate.json --json

`candidate.template.json` shows the submission shape. Each component is exactly
16 bytes, represented as 32 uppercase hexadecimal characters. Leave unresolved
components as null. The checker reports each slot independently and checks the
combined commitment once all eight slots are present. It contains no recovery
secrets. Changing the checker or its commitments does not recover the archive.

Acceptance does not require running downloaded code or modifying any service.
